# Express Servers

## Overview

Today we will build our own custom Express server in Node.js. We will server our front end static files and dive more deeply into the WRRC.

## Notes

- What is a server?
  - In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the clientâ€“server model.
    - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))

- What is express?
  - You can use Node.js to create a simple web server using the Node HTTP package.
    - Other common web-development tasks, like GET, POST, and DELETE are not directly supported by Node itself.
    - If you want to do more than just READ, you will either need to write the code yourself, or you can use a web framework, like Express!
  - Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.
    - Express is the enviroment in which we build our server in.
    - Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and create custom responses for different HTTP paths.

1. What is a PORT?
  - Listens on a [Port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking))
    - In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint.
    - At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or application.
    - A port number is always associated with the host's IP address and the type of transport protocol (HTTP method) used for communication.

- What is cors?
  - [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
    - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    - "Body Guard of the Internet"
    - CORS is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
    - CORS developed in response to browser security and vulerabilities.
      - <https://medium.com/@electra_chong/what-is-cors-what-is-it-used-for-308cafa4df1a>
    - CORS failures result in errors but for security reasons, specifics about the error are not available to JavaScript. All the code knows is that an error occurred.

- Why do we need a server?
  - Servers connect applications across the internet
  - Set us up to scale our application, without hammering the API.
  - Provide our application a single source to fetch all of the data it needs.
  - Allow a server to do the hard work of formatting data to feed our front end.
  - Servers may have better/faster connections to other servers, making it more efficient than the browser doing this job.
  - Secure our keys, when HTTP Referrer restrictions aren't an option

1. Basic express server:

   ```javaScript
   'use strict';

   // this library lets us access our .env file
   require('dotenv').config();

   // express is a server library
   const express = require('express');

   // initalizes the express library
   const app = express();

   // library that determines who is allowed to speak to our server
   const cors = require('cors');


   // this settting says that everyone is allowed to speak to our server
   app.use(cors());

   // we are getting the port variable from the .env file.
   const PORT = process.env.PORT;

   // this is a route. if you turn the server on and go to http://localhost:3001/ (or whatever port you specified in your .env), you will see 'hello from the home route'
   app.get('/', (request, response) => {
     response.send('hello from the home route');
   });

   // this turns the server on to the port that you specifed in your .env file
   app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`listening on ${PORT}`));
   ```

1. You can set up a route that your front-end can hit. Your server will return information on that route:

   ```javaScript
   // FRONT-END
   await axios.get('http://localhost:3001/cats');

   // BACK-END
   app.get('/cats', (request, response) => {
     response.send('cats are the best');
   });
   ```

1. You can also send information from the front-end to the back-end as a query.

   - Queries live in the URL after the question mark: `http://localhost:3000/?city=seattle`
   - To send that query to the back-end via axios, you could write code like:

     ```javaScript
     //FRONT-END
     await axios.get('http://localhost:3001/city', {params: { city: 'seattle' }});

     // BACK-END
     app.get('city', (request, response) => {
       const city = reqeust.query.city;
       response.send(`you sent the city of ${city}`)
     });
     ```
